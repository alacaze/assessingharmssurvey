# Background

Clinicians must assess drug benefits and harms from clinical research in order to make clinically appropriate therapeutic decisions for patients. 
Reported statistical results inform inferences regarding the effects of drugs. 
Appropriate interpretation of $p$-values and confidence intervals is essential to guide judicious therapeutic decision-making. 
Nevertheless, current research suggests that $p$-values and confidence intervals are often misinterpreted [@Hemming2021; @Gigerenzer2004].

Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the most
commonly used and taught approach to statistical inference [@Hoekstra:2014hf; @Gigerenzer2004; @Doll2005].
However, this approach has been criticized extensively from a range of perspectives [REFS].
One common problem is the habitual misinterpretation of NHST results [@Hoekstra:2014hf]. 
Oakes -@Oakes1986 studied misinterpretation of NHST outcomes amongst 70 academic psychologists by proposing a scenario involving a statistically significant $p$-value accompanied by six false interpretations of the results. 
The results indicated that on average participants endorsed 2.5 of the false interpretations.
Similar results have been observed by @Falk1995, @Gigerenzer2004 and @Haller2002 in the understanding of NHST outcomes among professors teaching statistics. 
Furthermore, misinterpretations were reported amongst statisticians working in pharmaceutical development [@Lecoutre2003], as well as doctors and dentists [@Wulff1987].
Collectively, these studies suggest misinterpretation of key statistical results are common among professionals irrespective of experience or area of expertise.

The primary criticism of NHST is the dichotomization of evidence based on $p$-value significance at an arbitrary cut-off at 0.05 [@Fidler2009; @Neyman1937].
Statistical significance is often misconstrued as evidence of effect or no effect [@Hemming2021].
Confidence intervals are often proposed as an alternative to NHST for statistical inference as a solution to the misinterpretation of point estimate significance testing [@Fidler2009; @Cumming2001].
Hoekstra et al.^1^ defines a CI as "a numerical interval constructed around the estimate of a parameter." (add 95% true interpretation?) 
Cumming and Finch^13^ support the use of confidence intervals for statistical inference as confidence intervals provide point and interval estimates allowing for better interpretation.

Hoekstra et al.^1^ evaluated how psychology students and researchers
interpret confidence intervals in a study similar to. The questionnaire was adopted from
the questionnaire used in the Gigrenzer^8^ study. The results were
consistent with the previous studies and suggested that performance did
not commensurate with experience or education, as the researchers and
students misinterpreted the confidence intervals similarly.^1^ Though confidence intervals were proposed
to attenuate the tendency to dichotomize evidence, Hoekstra et al.^1^
concluded that confidence intervals are employed as an alternative method to significance
testing.

This project aims to assess how pharmacists and pharmacy students assess
evidence of drug harms. A survey has been developed to evaluate the
primary resources participants consult for evidence of drug harms, as
well as their ability to appropriately interpret statistical
findings(?).

Questions have been assumed from Hoekstra et al.^1^ and Gigrenzer^8^
studies, to appraise participants' ability to interpret $p$-values and
confidence intervals. (expand on statements?)
